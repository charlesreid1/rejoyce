    "In Part I, we applied NLTK to James Joyce's _Ulysses_ and found some interesting features of Chapter 8, Lestrygonians. We started by analyzing characters and letter frequencies, and then moved on to words. In this notebook, we'll be looking at phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we'll try and improve the part of speech tagger by looking at the text at the phrase level, and we'll also apply some chunking algorithms to the text to chunk words into phrases based on their parts of speech.\n",
